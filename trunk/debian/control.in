Description: FLAC librarian and transcoder with wxWidgets GUI
  Flacenstein creates, organizes, and transcodes a particular type
  of FLAC file: ones with embedded cuesheets, VORBIS style comment
  blocks, and (optionally) cover art embedded with the flac-image
  tool.  That is, it stores all the information easily obtained from
  a CD in one convenient file.  These files are directly supported by
  some players, such as the Slim Devices slimserver.
  .
  A libparanoia-based ripper and the ability to transcode FLAC files to
  lossy formats such as MP3 and MPEG4/AAC (for the iPod) are provided.
