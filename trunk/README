This source distribution is configured to use CDBS, which in turn depends
on the Python distutils modules.  This means that if all the stars are in 
alignment, all you should have to do to produce a Debian package is:

$ fakeroot debian/rules clean # (force cdbs to generate debian/control)
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

Alternatively, if you don't care to make a .deb package but you do have
a working Python environment, you should be able to install this like
any other Python package:

$ python setup.py install

Have fun...
